# Shop-Basket
Please note that everything mentioned below works on macOS. If you are using a different machine and get stuck at a specific stage, the instructions for your machine might be different. When trying to find a solution on Google, please mention your operating system, e.g. Windows.

Prerequisites: 
1) Install **sbt**
2) `Code editor or IDE` of choice needs to installed (for example IntelliJ IDEA). 

Project set-up:
1) Start by creating a `new directory` on your machine (for where you will clone the repository).
2) To `clone the repository` please follow the steps here: [Cloning a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) using the HTTPS method.

Once the project has been cloned run the project by:
1) `Open terminal or command prompt` and navigate to the project directory. If you do not know how to navigate in terminal please see: [Navigating the File System with Terminal](https://gomakethings.com/navigating-the-file-system-with-terminal/#:~:text=Type%20the%20cd%20command%2C%20followed,you%20want%20to%20navigate%20to.&text=Paths%20are%20relative%20to%20the,the%20currently%20logged%20in%20user)
2) Start the sbt shell by running commad: `sbt`
3) This should start the sbt shell and compile the code. Next run the code by simply typing `run`.

A welcome message should be printed in the console with the list of items and instructions. 
Next, you should be able to input item numbers into the terminal or command prompt and hit enter.
Finally the shopping basket calculations should be displayed, if item numbers are input incorretly then you should see an invalid input message. 

That's it, thank you for using the Shop-Basket calculator.
